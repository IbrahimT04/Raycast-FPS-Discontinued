# RayCast FPS (Discontinued)
This is an older version of the Block Shooter and Retro Reqium projects. It was made as a possible way of using c/c++ files with python ctypes import to optamize the game further. But due to its clock speed limitations and heightened complexity, it is discontinued.

You would need to download libstdc++-6.dll dependancy file and maybe some other dependancy files to run this project based on your computer hardware. This current project contains most of the c++ compilled files in the dll folder but which works with x64 systems. It is still recommended to recompile the compute.cpp and use the new file and your computer's c++ compiler dependancies instead.
